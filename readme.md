# Typescript Web Framework

Sample app that implements the basics of a web framework that may be recongnisable to `Backbone.js` and `Marionette.js` users from before react took a grip on web development. The purpose is to show a working example investigating scenarios that typically drive a team to choose between inheritance and composition for their patterns.

The repo is less about the final product which is very rudimentary and definitely **not in any way a produciton ready framework**. The repository is more about the design patterns chosen when working the problem set at hand and covering how they might be approached and implemented using TypeScript.
